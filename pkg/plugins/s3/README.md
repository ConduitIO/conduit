# S3 Connector

## Source
The S3 Source Connector connects to an S3 bucket with the provided configurations, using
`aws.bucket`, `aws.access-key-id`,`aws.secret-access-key` and `aws.region`. Then will
call `Open` to start the connection. If the bucket doesn't exist, or the permissions
fail, then the `Open` method will fail, and the Connector will not be ready to Read.

### Change Data Capture (CDC)
This connector implements CDC features for S3 by scanning the bucket for changes every
`polling-period` and detecting any change that happened after a certain timestamp. These
changes (update, delete, insert) are then inserted into a buffer that is checked on each
Read request.
* To capture "delete" actions, the S3 bucket versioning must be enabled, and the output
  record will have a metadata of `"action":"delete"`.
* To capture "insert" or "update" actions, the bucket versioning doesn't matter, and no
  metadata is added for these actions.

### Testing
You must set the environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`)
before you can run the tests.
The tests have the tag "integration", so they can be run using `make test-integration`.


#### Position Handling
The connector goes through two modes.
* Snapshot mode: which loops through the S3 bucket and returns the objects that are
  already in there. The _Position_ during this mode is the object key attached to
  an underscore, an "s" for snapshot, and the _maxLastModifiedDate_ found so far.
  As an example: "thisIsAKey_s12345", which makes the connector know at what
  mode it is and what object it last read. The _maxLastModifiedDate_ will be used when
  changing to CDC mode, the iterator will capture changes that happened after that.

* CDC mode: this mode iterates through the S3 bucket every `polling-period` and captures
  new actions made on the bucket. the _Position_ during this mode is the object key
  attached to an underscore, a "c" for CDC, and the object's _lastModifiedDate_ in seconds.
  As an example: "thisIsAKey_c1634049397".
  This position is used to return only the actions with a _lastModifiedDate_ higher than
  the last record returned, which will ensure that no duplications are in place.


### Record Keys
The S3 object key uniquely identifies the objects in an Amazon S3 bucket, which is why a
record key is the key read from the S3 bucket.

### Configuration
The config passed to `Open` can contain the following fields.

| name                  | description                                                                            | required  | example             |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|---------------------|
| aws.access-key-id     | AWS access key id                                                                      | yes       | "THE_ACCESS_KEY_ID" |
| aws.secret-access-key | AWS secret access key                                                                  | yes       | "SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" |
| aws.region            | the AWS S3 bucket region                                                               | yes       | "us-east-1"         |
| aws.bucket            | the AWS S3 bucket name                                                                 | yes       | "bucket_name"       |
| polling-period        | polling period for the CDC mode, formatted as a time.Duration string. default is "1s"  | no        | "2s", "500ms"       |


### Known Limitations
* If a pipeline restarts during the snapshot, then the connector will start scanning the
  objects from the beginning of the bucket, which could result in duplications.


## Destination
The S3 Destination Connector connects to an S3 bucket with the provided configurations, using
`aws.bucket`, `aws.access-key-id`,`aws.secret-access-key` and `aws.region`. Then will
call `Open` to start the connection. If the bucket doesn't exist, or the permissions
fail, then the `Open` method will fail, and the Connector will not be ready to Write.

### Writer
The S3 destination writer has a buffer with the size of `buffer-size`, for each time 
`Write` is called, a new record is added to the buffer. When the buffer is full, 
all the records from it will be written to the S3 bucket configured.

### Configuration
The config passed to `Open` can contain the following fields.

| name                  | description                                                                                                     | required | example             |
