# OpenAPI

This directory contains an abbreviated copy of the following repository:

- `swagger-ui` - <https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui> 8e6824cb452ae4b268f45f5203575194217c6653 (LICENSE, dist/)

The `swagger-ui` directory contains HTML, JavaScript, and CSS assets that dynamically generate Swagger documentation
from a Swagger-compliant API definition in [api.swagger.json](./swagger-ui/api/v1/api.swagger.json) file.
That file is auto-generated by running `make proto` in the root of this repository. The static assets are copied
from [this dist folder](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/tree/master/dist) of the swagger-ui project. After
copying, [`swagger-initializer.js`](./swagger-ui/swagger-initializer.js) is edited to load the swagger file from the
local server instead of the default petstore. All `*.js.map` files are removed to decrease the size of the binary.

See the [LICENSE](./swagger-ui/LICENSE) file for applicable license terms.
