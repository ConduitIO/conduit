// Node represents a single node in a pipeline that knows how to process
// messages flowing through a pipeline.
type Node interface {
	// ID returns the identifier of this Node. Each Node in a pipeline must be
	// uniquely identified by the ID.
	ID() string

	// Run first verifies if the Node is set up correctly and either returns a
	// descriptive error or starts processing messages. Processing should stop
	// as soon as the supplied context is done. If an error occurs while
	// processing messages, the processing should stop and the error should be
	// returned. If processing stopped because the context was canceled, the
	// function should return ctx.Err(). All nodes that are part of the same
	// pipeline will receive the same context in Run and as soon as one node
	// returns an error the context will be canceled.
	// Run has different responsibilities, depending on the node type:
	//  * PubNode has to start producing new messages into the outgoing channel.
	//    The context supplied to Run has to be attached to all messages. Each
	//    message will be either acked or nacked by downstream nodes, it's the
	//    responsibility of PubNode to handle these acks/nacks if applicable.
	//    The outgoing channel has to be closed when Run returns, regardless of
	//    the return value.
	//  * SubNode has to start listening to messages sent to the incoming
	//    channel. It has to use the context supplied in the message for calls
	//    to other functions (imagine the message context as a request context).
	//    It is the responsibility of SubNode to ack or nack a message if it's
	//    processed correctly or with an error. If the incoming channel is
	//    closed, then Run should stop and return nil.
	//  * PubSubNode has to start listening to incoming messages, process them
	//    and forward them to the outgoing channel. The node should not ack/nack
	//    forwarded messages. If a message is dropped and not forwarded to the
	//    outgoing channel (i.e. filters), the message should be acked. If an
	//    error is encountered while processing the message, the message has to
	//    be nacked and Run should return with an error. If the incoming channel
	//	  is closed, then Run should stop and return nil. The outgoing channel
	//    has to be closed when Run returns, regardless of the return value.
	//    The incoming message pointers need to be forwarded, as upstream nodes
	//    could be waiting for acks/nacks on that exact pointer. If the node
	//    forwards a new message (not the exact pointer it received), then it
	//    needs to forward any acks/nacks to the original message pointer.
