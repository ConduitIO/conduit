// registry is an object that can create new plugin dispensers. We need to use
// an interface to prevent a cyclic dependency between the plugin package and
// builtin and standalone packages.
// There are two registries that implement this interface:
// * The builtin registry create a dispenser which dispenses a plugin adapter
//   that communicates with the plugin directly as if it was a library. These
//   plugins are baked into the Conduit binary and included at compile time.
// * The standalone registry creates a dispenser which starts the plugin in a
//   separate process and communicates with it via gRPC. These plugins are
//   compiled independently of Conduit and can be included at runtime.
